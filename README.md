This project was an attempt at building a java game engine based off of [lwjgl](https://www.lwjgl.org/). It has quite a few features but I never built any games with it other than having a small demo in 'net.game'. I built this project in the summer of 2013 following into the first few months of the school year. This project was built following the guidance of the tutorials found [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEETnX-uPtBXP_B2yupUKlflXBznWIlL5) made by [thebennybox](https://www.youtube.com/user/thebennybox).

It uses the lwjgl bindings for OpenGL to draw the 3D graphics. In the course of this project I learned a lot about how video game graphics were rendered and 3D graphics in general were rendered onto computers. Specifically I learned about:
* How 3D models are made of meshes of triangles
* The way in which matrices are used to apply transformations to a scene, e.g. camera rotations and transitions as matrices.
* How shaders are used to manipulate vertices within vertex shaders and to manipulate pixels in fragment shaders.

The project also used the [slick-util](http://slick.ninjacave.com/slick-util/) library for resource loading (images / textures).
